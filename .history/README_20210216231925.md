# Project-Burger

Project-Burger is a small end to end project that allows you to add, edit, and view the burgers in the database.

## Installation

If you wanted to use it on your local machine, run 'npm i' for the node modules and change the connection.js to include your password

## Usage

Make sure you enter your mysql password into the connection.js in the db folder. Make sure you use the schema to create the tables necessary to run the program. You could use the data in the seed file or you could insert your own data as you see fit. In the terminal, type in 'node server.js' to start the program. There will be a list of choices for you to pick from. Pick whichever you need to do.
